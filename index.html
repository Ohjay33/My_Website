                <p>I'm passionate about learning, transparency, and collaboration. After starting my career in banking,
                    I discovered I love programming because it perfectly blends my problem-solving skills, creative
                    strengths and leadership abilities.
                    I recently graduated from 2 Dev Bootcamp's 1,000-plus hour programming apprenticeship where I
                    learned
                    Ruby, JavaScript, Rails, the MEAN stack other other technologies.
                    In my free time, I love to play basketball, ride bikes and watch sports on tv.</p>

                        <p>It's important to me to be a well rounded developer. Some of the tools in my toolbox are:
                            Ruby on Rails, Node.js, Express, AngularJS, React, MongoDB, HTML, CSS, Git, GitHub, Heroku,
                            and Bootstrap.</p>

                        <p>I am constantly seeking new ways to improve the way a user interacts with my designs. It's
                            easy for me to put myself in the users' position and build applications from their
                            perspective.</p>

                        <p>Collaborating on projects is one of my favorite things to do. I am easy to get along with and
                            can make the best out of any situation. I have a lot of energy and enthusiasm which is often
                            contagious!</p>
